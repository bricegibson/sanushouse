            <p>How We Work</p>
        </h1>
        <p>
            Sanus House is about your recovery. It is our goal to build a community of support, strength and courage to 
            overcome the things that destroy us and eat away at our souls. We aren't here to tell you what to do and when
            to do it. We belive in and promote ownership and self care. You own your recovery. We aren't here to force
            anyone into recovery. We know recovery only happens when the individual has a burning desire to change.
            It's a desire that is stronger than the desire to hide in the shadows of darkness.

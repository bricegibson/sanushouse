                Sanus House is about your recovery. It is our goal to build a community of support, strength and courage
                to overcome the things that destroy us and eat away at our souls. We aren't here to tell you what to do and
                when to do it. We believe in and promote ownership and self care. You own your recovery. We aren't here to
                force anyone into recovery. We know recovery only happens when the individual has a burning desire to change.
                It's a desire that is stronger than the desire to hide in the shadows of darkness. You can 
                review all the House rules <a href="houserules.html" target="_self">here</a>.
